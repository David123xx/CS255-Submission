# CS255-Submission

    Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
    DriverPass project was a project that took course over the 8 week course. Starting from an interview we designed a system for a company named DriverPass. They wanted us to design a web-based system that allowed purchasing and creating appointments for their company.
    
    What did you do particularly well?
    I felt like I did a great job taking the information from the interview and putting it into the business requirements document. I tried to get as detailed as I could with as much information from the interview.
    
    If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    I wish I could revise the UML diagrams. I feel that they could have been more detailed and have better showcased the design of the system I was creating.
    
    How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    I took a lot of my understanding for what the needs of the user was from the interview. After that I looked at what was given and was not given for information and put them into the system's limitations section of project 1's business requirements document. Its always important to consider the user's needs. If you don't you aren't designing a system for the end user. By this you might miss important functions, or have unnecessary functions for the system.
    
    How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
    From this assignment I found the interview was one of the most helpful parts about this. I think that the ability to get the needs of the user through questions to be a very helpful factor. Some ways to help develop this system would have been to look at how other companies have created their system, as well having interviews with other members of the staff. The final information collection that I would do is seeing what system they currently have and how it works to make it more beneficial for the company and user experience. From there I think that a helpful strategy is creating consistent documentation of what was found, what would work, what won't work.
